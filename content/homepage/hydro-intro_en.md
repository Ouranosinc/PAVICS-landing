PAVICS offers a suite of tools to streamline the analysis of climate change's impacts on hydrology. It relies on [Raven](http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/), an hydrological modeling framework that lets hydrologists define custom hydrological models or emulate existing ones. These models are minimally driven by daily time series of temperature and precipitation, and return series of flow and state variables such as snow pack and soil water.

The platform can, among other functionalities
  * simulate stream flow using one of four global models: HMETS, GR4J-CemaNeige, HBV-EC and MOHYSE;
  * run frequency analyses on flow series;
  * extract physiographic properties of watersheds;
  * estimate model parameters in ungauged basins;
  * make hydrological predictions from numerical weather forecasts.
